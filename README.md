# Fluid User Scripts

This repository contains user scripts for single site browsers
made with [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com).

Note: Facebook and Google change their class IDs frequently, so if notifications
aren't working, submit an issue and I'll update the scripts.

## Installation

First of all, you need a premium version of [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com). If you
don't have that, custom user scripts won't work.

1. Create a new Fluid app for the service you want.
2. Add an icon for the app in *Preferences* > *General* > *Application icon*;
   you're free to use the icons made available in this repository.
3. Go to *<App Name>* > *User Agent* > *Chrome/Safari*
4. Go to *Window* > *Userscripts*
5. Add a new script with the pattern(s) listed in the user script you want to
   add.
6. Copy in code from the user script.
7. Quit and reopen the app.
